**Real-time tRadar Visualization Platform**

tRadar Terminal provides you unprecedented visibility into tRadar, the heart of tPay network, through an intuitive, real-time visualization interface. This terminal transforms complex financial risk analysis into clear, actionable insights through dynamic network visualization.

## **What You'll See**

### üîç **Live Transaction Flow Visualization**

Watch transactions flow through our tPay network in real-time as animated connections between agent nodes. Each transaction is represented by smooth, curved lines that dynamically adapt to network topology, providing immediate visual context for transaction patterns and volumes.

### ü§ñ **Agentic Risk Assessment in Action**

Observe our AI validator agents analyzing transactions in real-time by scrolling to zoom in. See the actual process unfold as floating text boxes that display the Validator Agent's complex reasoning process.

You‚Äôll also see how different validator agents coordinate with each other. At the core of tRadar is a **diverse network of Validator Agents**, which we call the **VAN**‚ÄîValidator Agent Network. On this terminal, you‚Äôll be able to observe how this network operates in real time. All validator agents run under the same MCP server, and you‚Äôll get to see their collaboration, voting, and decision-making processes in action.

### **Transaction Context: Complete Agent Data Trail**

You can also view the detailed and complete transaction context directly in the interface. This includes the full Agent Reasoning data trail collected by our tPay SDK. From here, you can also get a glimpse of the data received by the large-scale Validator Agent Network.

### **A Glimpse into the Agent‚Äôs Financial Profile**

On this terminal, you can also view a visual representation of each Agent‚Äôs **virtual account**. This is a key feature of the tLedger. Every Agent is assigned a unique Agent ID, which functions as their ‚Äúbank account.‚Äù With this ID, neither the Agent nor the developer or end user needs to worry about wallets or assets across different chains ‚Äî tLedger handles all supported cross-chain transactions and swaps automatically.

*A sales commission Agent for an e-commerce company receives real-time sales data and autonomously pays out commissions in SOL on Solana, even though the buyer paid in ETH on Ethereum. The recipient Agents receive USD stablecoins on Base, based on their preferred payout setting.*

*A cross-border payroll Agent detects that it‚Äôs the end of the month and automatically initiates salary payments using USDT on Tron, while employees‚Äô Agents receive INR-denominated stablecoins on Polygon or BTC on Lightning, depending on their configured local preferences.*

*An IoT-connected Agent managing a solar panel autonomously sells excess energy credits in XLM on Stellar, then sends the revenue‚Äîafter conversion‚Äîto its owner's Agent account in ETH on Ethereum to be reinvested in a DeFi yield vault.*

*A subscription billing Agent managing SaaS licenses detects renewal time, pulls payment from a client‚Äôs wallet in AVAX on Avalanche, and forwards the converted USDC on Ethereum to the service provider‚Äôs Agent.*

## üìä **What You Can Do**

* **Agent Nodes**: Circular nodes representing individual agents, hover or click to see the agent details
* **Transactuon Visualization**: Zoom in to check the real-time validating process, hover or click to see the payment transaction details
* **Status Indicators**: Real-time color transitions showing transaction states (initiated ‚Üí validating ‚Üí completed/failed)
