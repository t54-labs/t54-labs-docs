| Create agent financial profiles            | Assign each AI agent a virtual financial account, configure daily spend limits, and manage the agent’s financial assets.                                                                                                                |
| Trigger agent-to-agent payments            | Enable your agents to send payments to other agents or third-party t54 agents using secure, programmable infrastructure.                                                                                                                |
| Delegate payments securely                 | Leverage t54’s KYA (Know Your Agent) and validator agents to verify behavior, enforce credit caps, and prevent fraud or hallucinated transactions.                                                                                      |
| Build merchant payout rails                | Integrate compliant payout flows to human merchants—allowing agents to pay for services, subscriptions, or contractual work.                                                                                                            |
| Unlock agent monetization                  | Set up fee-sharing structures and reward tokens so agents can earn for completed tasks—similar to SaaS-style commissions or usage-based incentives.                                                                                     |

| Audit and analyze                          | Track balances, review transaction history, and export logs for compliance or analytics—accessible via API or the t54 Portal.                                                                                                           |
