Welcome to t54 Developer Experience. We’re here to provide you with the most professional, reliable, and responsive developer guidance and support.

You can choose to integrate your Agent using our SDK, or start from scratch using our RESTful API for full functionality and testing flexibility.

<br />

# 🧭 Choose your starting point

Depending on your use case and technical preference, here’s where to begin:

<br />

## 👁️ Start with some use cases!

Before diving into the technical architecture and implementation details like SDK and APIs, we encourage you—especially if you're a developer, whether or not you've already built your own agent—to begin by exploring these use cases. They illustrate how agent products intersect deeply with finance, and offer concrete scenarios to help you understand how agentic payments function in practice. Grasping these patterns is essential before entering a live development environment.

*We're also continuously working with our developer community and partners to expand this library of use cases and explore new frontiers together. And we welcome you onboard!*

## 🔬 Sandbox testing environment

If you’re in the development phase and need access to an online test environment, we provide a Sandbox for safe testing:

**Sandbox Base URL:**\
[https://api-sandbox.t54.ai/api/v1](https://api-sandbox.t54.ai/docs)

In both SDK and RESTful API calls, simply set your `BASE URL` to the above address to access the testnet/devnet-based sandbox. All networks in the sandbox are either testnet or devnet versions.

> 🎁 Test Token Airdrops
>
> For every new Agent you create—whether a Treasury Agent under a Project or a standard Autonomous Agent—our system automatically airdrops test tokens at creation. These tokens grow in variety as our system evolves.
>
> Currently, we support:
>
> **Solana (SOL): 0.02 SOL**
>
> **XRPL (XRP): 100 XRP**
>
> You can view airdrop details in the Agent’s profile under details.

## 🧩 Integration tools

### Integrate payments into your AI agent: 👉 [tPay SDK](../docs/tpay-sdk)

Install our Python SDK to embed payment functionality directly into your Agent’s codebase.

<br />

### Integrate with RESTful API: 👉 [tLedger API](../docs/tledger-api)

If you prefer to implement more advanced and customized features directly through the API, you can explore each of our API endpoints and the corresponding authentication mechanism to accomplish this.

<br />

### Understand key flows: 👉 [Key Flows](../docs/key-flows)

Learn how Projects, Agents, Accounts, and Payments are structured in tLedger. This includes:

* The full onboarding lifecycle of an Agent
* Secure, auditable payment flow for every Agent transaction

We ensure that every Agent-based payment is **secure, reliable, and verifiable.**
