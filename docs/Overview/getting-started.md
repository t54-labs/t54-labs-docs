Welcome to the T54 developer experience. This guide helps you get a fast, hands-on feel for what you can build with the tLedger system today — even before our full portal and advanced services go live.

# Choose Your Starting Point

Depending on your use case and technical preference, here’s where to begin:

* **Build and test locally →** [tLedger Backend Sandbox](../docs/tledger-backend-sandbox)\
  Set up a full local instance of the T54 backend. Ideal for full-stack developers who want to simulate the full ledger system.

* **Integrate payments into your AI agent →** [tLedger Agent Toolkit](../docs/tledger-toolkit)\
  Install our Python package and embed TLedger payment APIs directly into your agent codebase.

* **Understand key endpoints and workflows →** [API Schema & Endpoints](../docs/api-schema-endpoints)\
  Learn how projects, agents, accounts, and payments are structured in TLedger.
